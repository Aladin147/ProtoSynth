        Currently, ProtoSynth can only handle binary sequences, but many real-world 
        prediction tasks involve multi-valued sequences (e.g., DNA with A/T/G/C).

        ```python
        # Multi-alphabet environment
        protosynth-evolve --env dna_k3 --alphabet ATGC --gens 100
        
        # Or programmatically:
        from protosynth.envs import multi_alphabet
        stream = multi_alphabet(alphabet="ATGC", pattern="ATGATG", seed=42)
        ```
